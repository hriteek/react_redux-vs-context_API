I have cloned this project from [link](https://github.com/academind/react-redux-vs-context/tree/redux) and followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvM4hIxrqAw&t=152s) to convert the code that was using Redux for state management to use Context API for state management. I just compared two.

But the code used class based component so I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7XRX7nLsw), to convert the class based component into functional component with React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer).
